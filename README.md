# Portfolio
My personal website: (http://victorcazanave.com)

This is a temporary version until I find time to make a better one. So I guess it's the final version.

## Styles
The design is fully ~~a copy of~~ inspired by [Mister](http://mister.studio/).

I intentionally didn't use any CSS classes for... fun :)

Then it forced me to to keep it as simple as possible and consistent.
