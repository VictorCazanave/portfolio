# Portfolio

It should be online there: https://victorcazanave.com

This is a temporary version until I have time to make a better one. So I guess it's the final version.

## Projects

* [taiwan-weather](npmjs.com/package/taiwan-weather): a node.js module to fetch and filter weather data from Taiwan Central Weather Bureau API.
* [taiwan-weather-cli](npmjs.com/package/taiwan-weather-cli): CLI for taiwan-weather node.js module.
* [react-svg-map](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-svg-map): a React.js component to display an interactive SVG map.
* [oeteM](https://victorcazanave.com/oetem): a reverse weather forecast web application built with React.js.

## Styles

The design is fully ~~a copy of~~ inspired by [Mister](http://mister.studio/).

I intentionally didn't use any CSS classes for... fun :)

Then it forced me to to keep it as simple as possible and consistent.

## TODO

* Real portfolio
* i18n
