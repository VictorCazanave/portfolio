# Portfolio

_This is a temporary version until I have time to make a better one... Therefore I guess it's the final version_ ðŸ˜„

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

My goal was to create a simple, light and informative website to introduce myself.

The design is straigthforward to focus on the content.

I intentionally didn't use any CSS classes for... fun ðŸŽ‰

Then it forced me to to keep it as simple as possible and consistent.

I also played with "new" CSS features like grid and custom properties.
